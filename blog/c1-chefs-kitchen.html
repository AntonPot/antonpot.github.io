  <h2>School vs. Club</h2>

      Up until a couple of months ago, I was convinced it’s impossible that I would ever be excited about school. Maybe because Dev Bootcamp isn’t really a school per se, but it seems to be more like a club. How I imagine it, is that there are people with the same goal and all of them are doing their best to achieve it. Funny enough this goal goes for everyone, students and teachers alike. And the goal is to make everybody there, better.

        Better? Better how? In what? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, here’s the trick. Why school is a school, and a club is a club? Let’s take a look in that. I don’t know how the school looked like or felt like where you’re coming from, but for me it was complete torture. Sitting in classrooms, trying to listen to that monotonic voice, coming from a person who himself was bored to death, but just had to tell you that thing because some other people said so. I mean, how in the world could I held myself back from skipping it, or trying to find my own fun there, which of course had nothing to do with what the teacher was talking about.

      Now what about a club? It even sounds better. A club. “You can find me in a club.” “Let’s go out clubbing!” “A sports club.” It’s just a word. It can be used for many different things, but they all point to some sort of fun. What about school. Listen to it “Schoooooool”. OMG, I get chills down my spine. But what is a club actually? Dictionary says it’s: “A group of people organized for a common purpose, especially a group that meets regularly.” And there you go, “common purpose”. A goal!

      What I’m trying to say, is that schools don’t really give you wide enough spectre of knowledge due to their methods, and because of that we came to the point where children hate it, just like I did. And I still do, but I really love clubs. Maybe worst of all is, that people believe that the school is the only place where one can learn, and it is considered common sense. What a bunch of BS! Schools don’t have monopoly on knowledge! They push you to learn what today society believe is important to know, but they’ll never teach you to grow within. There’s a lot of NO! NO! NO! there, while I’m counting on Dev Bootcamp to show me that I can learn with YES! YES! YES! type of thinking. To be in an environment where it will motivate me to be hungry for my goal. You know, like in a club.

      Returning to “better”. Better in what? Better in everything! In wide spectre of being a better citizen of Planet Earth. Maybe the most important reason I decided to sign up for Dev, is that I knew that there would be people there whose purpose is to be better. People like me. People with common purpose.
