    <p>
      Classes. Why do we even need classes? 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, they can be really useful when writing your code, because you don't need to rewrite it when dealing with similar objects. Let's say for example, I need to create a few cars in my code. I'd go:
    </p>   
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>car_1_make = 'Audi'
  car_1_model = 'A4'
  car_1_colour = 'blue'
  car_1_engine = true
  car_1_number_of_wheels = 4</code></pre>    
    <p>
       And then I'd start with another:
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>car_2_make = 'VW'
  car_2_model = 'Passat'
  car_2_colour = 'black'
  car_2_engine = true
  car_2_number_of_wheels = 4</code></pre>
    <p>
      And another:
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>car_3_make = 'Ford'
  car_3_model = 'Mustang'
  car_3_colour = 'red'
  car_3_engine = true
  car_3_number_of_wheels = 4</code></pre>
    <p>
      Then I'd have to type something that my program will actually do for each car individually. It makes a mess with of all the variables, and there's so much repetition the head starts to hurt. So what we need is something that would keep this information for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at a simple class:
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    def initialize
      puts "Let's see some mean machines"
    end
  end</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      We added a method inside called <strong>initialize</strong> which means that whenever we make an instance of this class, it will be executed.
      <br>So let's do that:
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>obj = Car.new</code></pre>
    <p>
      It's that simple.
      <br>Now we have an object <strong>obj</strong> which is an instance of Car class (meaning it plays by the rules written in class Car), and since we said <code class="code">puts "Let's see some mean machines"</code> the output of the code will be:
    </p>
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> Let's see some mean machines</output>
      <p></p>
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is not what we are after. We need to make some cars! If we look at our variables defined at the beginning, we see all of our cars have engine and 4 wheels. That means we could put this information in initialize method, because it will always be the same with all the cars.
      <br>So let's do that:
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    def initialize
      engine = true
      number_of_wheels = 4
    end
  end</code></pre>
    <p>
      Awesome! Now let's try to test the code. Before we'll do that, we should enter some <code class="code">puts</code> just for testing reasons, so we'll see what's going on.
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    def initialize
      engine = true
      number_of_wheels = 4
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{number_of_wheels}"
    end
  end</code></pre>    
    <p>
      We create an instance like before:
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>obj = Car.new</code></pre>
    <p>
      And our output is:
    </p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4</output>
      <p></p>
    <p>
      Yeey!!! We're doing great!
    </p>
    <p>
      So we have a car that has an engine and 4 wheels, but what about the rest of the car? This is something that isn't the same with all the cars, so we have to be able to access it an change it. For that we'll need to add new methods in our class. One method that runs once, just when class initializes won't make it. We need more! One thing to mention is, that it is very common to name the methods in classes so they end with equal sign (=). Why is this good? We'll see a bit later, but let's just remember to do that when we make them.
    </p>
    <p>
      First we'll add the colour of the car, just to see how this goes first.
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    def initialize
      engine = true
      number_of_wheels = 4
      puts engine
      puts number_of_wheels
    end
    def colour=
      colour = 'blue'
      puts colour
    end
  end</code></pre>    
    <p>
      We added another method, named it as it should be named, and added some value <code class="code">blue</code> to the variable <code class="code">colour</code>. Now we need to call it, but because only initialize method runs when object of the class <code class="code">obj</code> is created, we need to call it separately on the object, like so: 
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>obj = Car.new
  obj.colour=</code></pre>    
    <p>
      And we get an error:
    </p>
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> test.rb:15: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input<br>
      obj.color=</output>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's saying we can't end the line with '='.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok let's remove it:
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    def initialize
      engine = true
      number_of_wheels = 4
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{number_of_wheels}"
    end
    def colour
      colour = 'blue'
      puts "What is the colour? #{colour}"
    end
  end

  obj = Car.new
  obj.colour</code></pre>      
    <p>
      And the output is exactly what we want:
    </p>
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4<br>
      => What is the colour? => blue</output>
    </p>
    <p>
      But we want to change the colour, not have it hardcoded like here. We need to put the colour in when we call the method. First we need to change our method in the class so it will take some arguments like 'colour_argument' and then we'll assign the value when we'll call it.   
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    def initialize
      engine = true
      number_of_wheels = 4
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{number_of_wheels}"
    end
    def colour(colour_argument)
      colour = colour_argument
      puts "What is the colour? #{colour}"
    end
  end

  obj = Car.new
  obj.colour('blue')</code></pre>      
    <p>
      Output:
    </p>
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4<br>
      => What is the colour? => blue</output>
    </p>
    <p>
      Great! We got the same output as before, but we defined the colour when calling the method.
      <br>Awesome!
      <br>Now, let's return to that error we were given. Why was it raised, if we were suppose to put '=' at the end. OK, let's try it again, now that we have one argument and let's see what happens:
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    def initialize
      engine = true
      number_of_wheels = 4
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{number_of_wheels}"
    end
    def colour=(colour_argument)
      colour = colour_argument
      puts "What is the colour? #{colour}"
    end
  end

  obj = Car.new
  obj.colour = 'blue'</code></pre>
    <p>
      Output:
    </p>
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4<br>
      => What is the colour? => blue</output>
    </p>
    <p>
      Alright!!!
      <br>Same output but look how much better and logical the call to the method looks like. It's almost like assigning the value to the method, where we know it's actually giving it some parameters, but it looks like so, and we love it!
    </p>
    <p>
      There's something I don't like about this class. It prints the attributes whenever I assign them. I want it to tell me when I want, and be quiet when I deal with the data. Let's create a method where we'll put all the <code class ="code">puts</code>.
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    def initialize
      engine = true
      number_of_wheels = 4
    end
    def colour=(colour_argument)
      colour = colour_argument
    end
    def display
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{number_of_wheels}"
      puts "What is the colour? #{colour}"
    end
  end</code></pre>
    <p>
      We didn't call it <code class ="code">display=</code> because it doesn't take any arguments, so it has to be called just <code class ="code">display</code>. Now we need to add another method call to our <code class ="code">obj</code> because we got a new method. Here we go:
    </p>
    <p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>obj = Car.new
  obj.colour = 'blue'
  obj.display</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Output:
    </p>
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> ./blogclass.rb:10:in `display': undefined local variable<br>
      or method `engine' for #&lt;Car:0x00000002c344a0> (NameError)<br>
      from ./blogclass.rb:18:in `&lt;main>'</output>
    </p>
    <p>
      Wait what?!?! Our engine variable doesn't exist, but it worked just fine before. Hmm? 
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess this has to do something with the fact that it is a local variable, which means it is only recognisable within that particular method. What we need is a variable which would be much more famous and be known all over the class. As it turns out, ruby offers a great solution for that, and it has something to do with emails! Yes, that's right! It's the <strong>@</strong> character. If we put @ in front of all of our variables we call in <code class ="code">display</code> we would rename them from local variable to instance variable. Let's do it:
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    def initialize
      @engine = true
      @number_of_wheels = 4
    end
    def colour=(colour_argument)
      @colour = colour_argument
    end
    def display
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{@engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{@number_of_wheels}"
      puts "What is the colour? #{@colour}"
    end
  end

  obj = Car.new
  obj.colour = 'blue'
  obj.display</code></pre>    
    <p>
      Output:
    </p>
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4<br>
      => What is the colour? => blue</output>
    </p>
    <p>
      YESSSSS!!! We rock!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's add all the rest of the features of the car, like make and model. We'll need to create a method for each of them, just like we did for colour.
    </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    def initialize
      @engine = true
      @number_of_wheels = 4
    end
    def colour=(colour_argument)
      @colour = colour_argument
    end
    def make=(make)
      @make = make
    end
    def model=(model)
      @model = model
    end
    def display
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{@engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{@number_of_wheels}"
      puts "What is the colour? #{@colour}"
    end
  end

  obj = Car.new
  obj.colour = 'blue'
  obj.make = 'Audi'
  obj.model = 'A4'
  obj.display</code></pre>    
    <p>
      Now we can finally give some value to the rest of our car, but the output would still be the same, so we need to create a method that would return the value we just added. It's a very simple method.
    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    def initialize
      @engine = true
      @number_of_wheels = 4
    end
    def colour=(colour_argument)
      @colour = colour_argument
    end
    def make=(make)
      @make = make
    end
    def make
      @make
    end
    def model=(model)
      @model = model
    end
    def model
      @model
    end
    def display
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{@engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{@number_of_wheels}"
      puts "What is the colour? #{@colour}"
    end
  end

  obj = Car.new
  obj.colour = 'blue'
  obj.make = 'Audi'
  p obj.make
  obj.model = 'A4'
  p obj.model
  obj.display</code></pre>   
    <p>
      Output:
    </p>
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> "Audi"<br>
      => "A4"<br>
      => Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4<br>
      => What is the colour? => blue</output>
    </p>
    <p>
      Pay attention to the fact that we could easily name the new methods which return the value <code class ="code">make</code> because the other one, which gathers value is called <code class ="code">make=</code>. Look as well at the test code, at the bottom where we call it. We added the <code class ="code">p</code> so it prints the output. It's easier like that then to change the code in the class. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything goes so smoothly, I'm so excited!
    </p>
    <p>
      If we look at the code, we see that it has a lot of repetition, and if you repeat yourself, people will not want to talk to you, because they'll be embarrassed to be seen in your company, so you better make sure your code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
    </p>     
    <p>
      So how to make this shorter? I'll tell you a secret that everybody who codes in ruby knows, so you better pay attention!

      These three can do some real magic. Let's implement one at the time:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>attr_reader</strong> replaces the the method that returns our value. This is the last method we implemented. Let's replace the one for the <code class ="code">make</code>, with <code class ="code">attr_reader :make</code>.
    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    attr_reader :make
    def initialize
      @engine = true
      @number_of_wheels = 4
    end
    def colour=(colour_argument)
      @colour = colour_argument
    end
    def make=(make)
      @make = make
    end
    def model=(model)
      @model = model
    end
    def model
      @model
    end
    def display
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{@engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{@number_of_wheels}"
      puts "What is the colour? #{@colour}"
    end
  end

  obj = Car.new
  obj.colour = 'blue'
  obj.make = 'Audi'
  p obj.make
  obj.model = 'A4'
  p obj.model
  obj.display</code></pre>
    <p>
      Output: 
    </p>
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> "Audi"<br>
      => "A4"<br>
      => Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4<br>
      => What is the colour? => blue</output>
    </p>
    <p>
      See? It works! And it's so much shorter to write. All you have to do is to add a symbol (it's name starting with ':') so the computer knows how to name it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's continue to the next one, <strong>attr_writer</strong>. Let's do it to the colour. It's the writer method that has been with us since the beginning, but now the time has come to update it to something more modern. Let's change it to:
      <br><code class ="code">attr_writer :colour</code>.
    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    attr_reader :make
    attr_writer :colour
    def initialize
      @engine = true
      @number_of_wheels = 4
    end
    def make=(make)
      @make = make
    end
    def model=(model)
      @model = model
    end
    def model
      @model
    end
    def display
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{@engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{@number_of_wheels}"
      puts "What is the colour? #{@colour}"
    end
  end

  obj = Car.new
  obj.colour = 'blue'
  obj.make = 'Audi'
  p obj.make
  obj.model = 'A4'
  p obj.model
  obj.display</code></pre>    
    <p>
      Output:
    </p>
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> "Audi"<br>
      => "A4"<br>
      => Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4<br>
      => What is the colour? => blue</output>
    </p>
    <p>
    Ahh. It's getting easier and easier to breath here. Let's finish with the last one, <strong>attr_accessor</strong>. For the previous two the name is very clear, and so is for this one. It combines both of the previous shortcuts into one super cool one. This means it does both reads and writes in one simple line. Let's do it to model, get rid of both methods, and use <code class="code">attr_accessor :model</code> instead.
    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    attr_reader :make
    attr_writer :colour
    attr_accessor :model
    def initialize
      @engine = true
      @number_of_wheels = 4
    end
    def make=(make)
      @make = make
    end
    def display
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{@engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{@number_of_wheels}"
      puts "What is the colour? #{@colour}"
    end
  end

  obj = Car.new
  obj.colour = 'blue'
  obj.make = 'Audi'
  p obj.make
  obj.model = 'A4'
  p obj.model
  obj.display</code></pre>    
    <p>
      Output:
    </p>
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> "Audi"<br>
      => "A4"<br>
      => Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4<br>
      => What is the colour? => blue</output>
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is how it's done! 
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's make our code even cooler. Let's put <code class="code">make</code> in <code class="code">attr_accessor</code> and add make <code class="code">display</code> method do it's job for everybody And finally, let's call the methods in a nicer manner. 
    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>class Car
    attr_accessor :make
    attr_writer :colour
    attr_accessor :model
    def initialize
      @engine = true
      @number_of_wheels = 4
    end
    def display
      puts "Is engine in the car? => #{@engine}"
      puts "How many wheels does it have? => #{@number_of_wheels}"
      puts "What is the colour? #{@colour}"
      puts "Which brand is it? => #{@make}"
      puts "And what model? => #{@model}"
    end
  end

  car1 = Car.new
  car1.colour = 'blue'
  car1.make = 'Audi'
  car1.model = 'A4'
  car1.display
  puts
  car2 = Car.new
  car2.colour = 'black'
  car2.make = 'VW'
  car2.model = 'Passat'
  car2.display
  puts
  car3 = Car.new
  car3.colour = 'red'
  car3.make = 'Ford'
  car3.model = 'Mustang'
  car3.display</code></pre>    
    <p>
      Output:
    </p> 
    <p>
      <output class='my_output'>=> Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4<br>
      => What is the colour? blue<br>
      => Which brand is it? => Audi<br>
      => And what model? => A4<br>
      => <br>
      => Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4<br>
      => What is the colour? black<br>
      => Which brand is it? => VW<br>
      => And what model? => Passat<br>
      => <br>
      => Is engine in the car? => true<br>
      => How many wheels does it have? => 4<br>
      => What is the colour? red<br>
      => Which brand is it? => Ford<br>
      => And what model? => Mustang</output>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now imagine you have this class in another file, and you just type the color, make and model, and it will print the whole car, just like that. Almost like magic.
    </p> 
    <p>
      So in case you still wondered, this is why we need classes.
