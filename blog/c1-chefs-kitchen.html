      Up until a couple of months ago, I was convinced it’s impossible that I would ever be excited about school. Maybe because Dev Bootcamp isn’t really a school per se, but it seems to be more like a club. How I imagine it, is that there are people with the same goal and all of them are doing their best to achieve it. Funny enough this goal goes for everyone, students and teachers alike. And the goal is to make everybody there, better. 
    </p>
    <p class="blog_text">
      Better? Better how? In what?
    </p>
    <p class="blog_text">
      Well, here’s the trick. Why school is a school, and a club is a club? Let’s take a look in that. I don’t know how the school looked like or felt like where you’re coming from, but for me it was complete torture. Sitting in classrooms, trying to listen to that monotonic voice, coming from a person who himself was bored to death, but just had to tell you that thing because some other people said so. I mean, how in the world could I held myself back from skipping it, or trying to find my own fun there, which of course had nothing to do with what the teacher was talking about.
    </p>
    <p class="blog_text">
      Now what about a club? It even sounds better. A club. “You can find me in a club.” “Let’s go out clubbing!” “A sports club.” It’s just a word. It can be used for many different things, but they all point to some sort of fun. What about school. Listen to it “Schoooooool”. OMG, I get chills down my spine. But what is a club actually? Dictionary says it’s: “A group of people organized for a common purpose, especially a group that meets regularly.” And there you go, “common purpose”. A goal! 
    </p>
    <p class="blog_text">
       What I’m trying to say, is that schools don’t really give you wide enough spectre of knowledge due to their methods, and because of that we came to the point where children hate it, just like I did. And I still do, but I really love clubs. Maybe worst of all is, that people believe that the school is the only place where one can learn, and it is considered common sense. What a bunch of BS! Schools don’t have monopoly on knowledge! They push you to learn what today society believe is important to know, but they’ll never teach you to grow within. There’s a lot of NO! NO! NO! there, while I’m counting on Dev Bootcamp to show me that I can learn with YES! YES! YES! type of thinking. To be in an environment where it will motivate me to be hungry for my goal. You know, like in a club. 
    </p>
    <p class="blog_text">
      Returning to “better”. Better in what? Better in everything! In wide spectre of being a better citizen of Planet Earth. Maybe the most important reason I decided to sign up for Dev, is that I knew that there would be people there whose purpose is to be better. People like me. People with common purpose.

      Battling my challenges I learned what the difference between them is and their basic use. Git is what you have installed on your own local machine. It is like a dude who you give some documents and he looks over every single thing that’s going on with them. You tell him to take care of them, and he does. He really does. He’ll keep note of all the changes that were ever made, and let you go back to big bang of your document, as long as you commit to him. And you keep doing that for every change. He’ll also make you a mirrored version of your document called branch. Hell, you can have as many branches as you want, and do with them whatever you want, while your master document is safely standing in front of the mirror.
    </p>
    <p class="blog_text">
      Git takes his job very seriously. He really does. He’ll guard your documents and all its information with his life. Only thing you need to do is to know how to talk to him. And this is where the Shell comes in. Yeap! No GUI goofing! You’re dealing with the big boys now! 
    </p>
    <p class="blog_text">
      Now, what about that best friend of his, what’s the name Git something? Yes, GitHub.com. It’s a web page, as you can probably figure out from his name. Well, Git and GitHub.com really are best buddies. What Git is doing for you on your computer, GitHub.com is doing on the internet. It allows you to talk to other peoples Git-s and their documents. You can check them out, make your own branch of them, and even make changes and suggest them to the owner. If he likes them, he can merge his document with your changes. Just one dude you only know by his GitHub.com username can incorporate your knowledge in his document. How cool is that!!! Well I’ll tell ya! It’s pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty cool!
